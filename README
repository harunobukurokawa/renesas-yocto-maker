* How to use ?

	yocto-make-vX.Y.Z [-b] [-s] [-e] target

	-b	: create yocto-vX.Y.Z-${target}-${date}-bin.tar.bz2
	-s	: create yocto-vX.Y.Z-${target}-${date}-src.tar.bz2
	-e	: create yocto-vX.Y.Z-${target}-${date}-env.tar.bz2
	target	: create target. depends on each versions

	ex)
		yocto-v5.1.0 -b -s h3ulcb

**  Note

	We can reuse the "build" when new version was released.
	But, something strange might be included if -b, -s, -e options were used.
	Removing build/tmp/deploy is better idea.
