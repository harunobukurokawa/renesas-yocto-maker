* What is this ?

	This helps you to compile Yocto for you.

* How to use ?
----------------------

	yocto-make [-bsea] version target

	-b	: create yocto-${version}-${target}-${date}-bin.tar.bz2
	-s	: create yocto-${version}-${target}-${date}-src.tar.bz2
	-e	: create yocto-${version}-${target}-${date}-env.tar.bz2
	-a	: Enable ADAS if target board is supporting it.
		  see below "ADAS"
	version	: 5.5.0
		  5.1.0
		  4.7.0
		  4.1.0
	target	: create target. depends on each versions

	ex)
		yocto-make -b -s 5.1.0 h3ulcb

**  Note

	We can reuse the "build" when new version was released.
	But, something strange might be included if -b, -s, -e options were used.
	Removing build/tmp/deploy is better idea.

** ADAS

	-a option is enabled if it was for StarterKit/Kingfisher for now.
